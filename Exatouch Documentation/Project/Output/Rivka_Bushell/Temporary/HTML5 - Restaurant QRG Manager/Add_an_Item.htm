        <p>An item is an offering that a merchant provides to their customer. Your business's list of items makes up your Menu/Inventory. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="EXA Table Service.Print and Screen">For example, your restaurant may offer a Garden Salad on the menu. Garden Salad would be an example of an item you would add to your Menu/Inventory.</MadCap:conditionalText><![CDATA[  ]]></p>
