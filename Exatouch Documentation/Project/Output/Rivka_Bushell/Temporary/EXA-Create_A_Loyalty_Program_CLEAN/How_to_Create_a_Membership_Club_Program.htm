        <h1>How to Create a Membership Club Program</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.EXAProductName" /> Membership program gives you the ability to reward frequent purchasers. Membership clubs give customers a percentage discount off the purchase of their entire order. At this time club memberships offer discounts on entire purchases; no exclusions are available at this time.</p>
        <p>Membership clubs are created in the <span class="Button">Loyalty</span> section. Multiple clubs can be created and maintained at the same time. Customers gain entry to a club by purchasing an item you designate as the <span class="Button">Membership Item</span>. </p>
        <p>If you wish to create a membership club program <MadCap:xref href="Contact_Technical_Support.htm">Contact Technical Support</MadCap:xref>  and ask them to activate the Loyalty Module.</p>
        <h2>Follow these instructions to create a Membership Club Program:</h2>
        <p>1. From Home, <MadCap:variable name="General.ct click or tap" /> <span class="Button">Customers</span>.</p>
        <p>2. Select <span class="Button">Loyalty</span>.</p>
        <p>Note: If you are unable to select the <span class="Button">Loyalty</span> option, <MadCap:xref href="Contact_Technical_Support.htm">Contact Technical Support</MadCap:xref> and ask them to activate the Loyalty Module.</p>
        <p>3. Select <span class="Button">Add Club</span>.</p>
        <p>4. Fill in <span class="Button">Club Membership</span> details.</p>
        <h3>Notable Fields:</h3>
        <p><span class="Button">Name</span>: Enter the club's name.</p>
        <p><span class="Button">Discount Percent</span>: Fill in the percentage discount that customers receive. For example 20.00 will give customers an automatic 20% discount off their entire order.</p>
        <p><span class="Button">Term</span>: Set an amount of time that club membership remains active. Choosing <span class="Button">No Expire</span> will leave membership active with no expiration date.</p>
        <p><span class="Button">Membership Item</span>:  Specify the membership item in the <span class="Button">Membership Item</span> field. An existing item within your system can be designated as a membership item, or you can create a new membership item for purchase.</p>
        <p class="panel note">Note: There are several ways that you can set up Club Membership:</p> <br /><p> 1. Encourage customers to purchase a specific item by giving them a Club Members hip when they purchase that item. </p><p>For example, set up a Star Club for  customers who purchase a cell phone. Designate "cell phone" as the <span class="Button">Membership Item</span>. When a customer purchases a cell phone, they gain membership to the Star Club. This program encourages clients to purchase cell phones.</p><p>2. Clients directly purchase a Club Membership.</p><p>For example, set up a Premiere Club which entitles customers to receive 5% off their entire order.  To set this up, create a new category called "Membership", and a new item called "Premier Membership". Designate  "Premier Membership" as the <span class="Button">Membership Item</span>, and assign the item a retail price of $100. When customers purchase "Premier Membership" for $100, they will automatically receive 5% off of their purchase price, deducted automatically at the register.</p><p class="panel xlink">
