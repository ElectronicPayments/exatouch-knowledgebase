        <h1>Use Training Mode</h1>
        <p>Training Mode is used to learn new features in your system, or to train a new employee. Training Mode acts as a "sandbox" that you can "play in" without affecting your real-time data. </p>
        <p>For example, in Training Mode you can practice adding staff members, adding items, or trying a new menu style without affecting the data stored in your <MadCap:variable name="General.EXAProductName" /> system.</p>
        <h2>To switch into Training Mode:</h2>
        <p>1. From the <span class="Button">Home</span> screen, <MadCap:variable name="General.ct click or tap" /> <span class="Button">Utilities</span>.</p>
        <p>2. Select <span class="Button">Switch to Training</span>.</p>
        <p>3. Confirm the switch to <span class="Button">Training Mode</span> by clicking <span class="Button">Yes</span>.</p>
        <p>While you are in Training Mode, a "Training Mode" banner will be displayed across the bottom of your <MadCap:variable name="General.EXAProductName" /> screen.</p>
        <p class="panel note tip">Don't forget! Nothing that you create in Training Mode is saved to your system. Be sure to exit Training Mode before you make real changes to your system.</p>
