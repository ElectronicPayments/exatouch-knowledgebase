        <p>1. From the <span class="Button">Home</span> screen, <MadCap:variable name="General.ct click or tap" /> <span class="Button">Staff. </span></p>
        <p>2. Select <span class="Button">Staff List</span>.</p>
        <p>3. Click on the name of the employee.</p>
        <p>4. Select the <span class="Button">Menu</span> option.</p>
        <p>5. Press <span class="Button">Delete</span>.</p>
        <p>6. Click <span class="Button">Yes</span> to confirm.</p>
        <p>Note: Staff members are not permanently deleted. &#160;Rather, they are deactivated so you can reference their history and re-activate them if needed.</p>
