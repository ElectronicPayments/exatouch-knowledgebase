        <h1>How to Set Tax Rates</h1>
        <p>Tax rates are defined in Groups. You can create one or multiple Tax Groups.</p>
        <p> For example, taxes applied to soda may be different from taxes applied to beer. So you would create Group A: Tax rates for soda and Group B: Tax rates for beer.</p>
        <p>1. From <span class="Button">Home</span>, <MadCap:variable name="General.ct click or tap" /> <span class="Button">Taxes</span>.</p>
        <p>2. Fill in <span class="Button">Group A - Tax rates</span> first. Click/tap into the tax fields and type in the desired tax rate.</p>
        <p>3. Enter the tax rates for <span class="Button">City tax rate</span>, <span class="Button">County tax rate</span>, <span class="Button">State tax rate</span>, and <span class="Button">Federal tax rate</span> where applicable.</p>
        <p>Notable Fields:</p>
        <p>Select the <span class="Button">Default for items</span> check box to apply the Group's tax rules to all items. Different tax rules can be applied later to individual items.</p>
        <p>See: <MadCap:xref href="Set_Tax_Rate_for_an_Individual_Item.htm">Set Tax Rate for an Individual Item</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Select the <span class="Button">Default for services</span> check box to apply the Group's tax rules to all services. Different tax rules can be applied later to individual services.</p>
        <p>See: <MadCap:xref href="Set_Tax_Rate_for_an_Individual_Service.htm">Set Tax Rate for an Individual Service</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>4. Create additional <span class="Button">Tax Groups</span> by filling in tax rates for each group (i.e. Group B, Group C...) </p>
        <p>5. Click <span class="Button">Save</span></p>
        <p>Note: Just as you can apply multiple tax rates to a single item, you can apply multiple Tax Groups as your System Default. For example, you can check <span class="Button">Default for items</span> in both Group A and Group B. </p>
