        <p>An item is an offering that a merchant provides to their customer. Your business's list of items makes up your Menu/Inventory. <![CDATA[  ]]></p>
        <p> As part of Exatouch's comprehensive service offering, we provide complimentary Menu/Inventory import service. When you first sign up for Exatouch, our in-house specialists will program your Menu and import your Inventory. If you choose not to use our Menu/Inventory import service, your <span class="Button">Items List</span> will be blank and you'll need to start adding items to your system. Even after your Menu/Inventory import is complete, you'll probably want to add additional items to your system.</p><a href="#dropdown1" data-toggle="collapse"><h2>How to Add an Item</h2></a>

            <p><span class="Button">Manufacturer</span>: Click <img src="D_Images/EXA_NewItem_ManufField_GearIcon.jpg" /> to add a new manufacturer, or you can add a new manufacturer by clicking:</p>
            <p><span class="Button">Home</span> &gt; <span class="Button">Settings</span>&gt; <span class="Button">System</span> &gt; <span class="Button">Custom Labels</span> &gt; <span class="Button">Manufacturer</span></p>

            <p><span class="Button">Sell options</span> allows you set a condition for the sale of your item. </p>
            <p>For example, if the sell option is <span class="Button">Stop selling at 0</span>, Exatouch will not allow the sale of the item when your inventory for that item is 0.</p>
            <p>There are several Sell options available:</p>
            <p><span class="Button">Not an inventory item</span> is the default setting in Exatouch. <span class="Button">Not an inventory item</span> is used if you are not tracking inventory for the item. For example, drop-ship items which are special ordered and not kept in stock are not an inventory item. Most restaurants do not consider their menu selections inventory items. </p>
            <p><span class="Button">Stop selling at 0</span> will limit the sale of the item once inventory reaches 0. </p>
            <p><span class="Button">Go negative</span> will allow the sale of the item if the inventory is 0. This option is useful for those times when your stock exceeds your inventory total. You can always modify your inventory to reflect additional stock..</p>
            <p>See <a href="Modify_Inventory_Level.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{para}">Modify Inventory Level</a></p>
            <p> Each item can be assigned a Sell Option. Sell options are modified in the <span class="Button">Preferences</span> section.</p>
            <p>See <a href="Modify_Sell_Options.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{para}">Modify Sell Options</a></p>
            <p><span class="Button">Tax</span>: The application of tax is defined through selection of a Tax Group.</p>
            <p>You can select multiple Tax Group check boxes (i.e. Group A and Group B are both checked), so that multiple tax rates apply to a single item.  </p>
            <p>Tax rates for each Group are defined in <span class="Button">Settings</span>:</p>
            <p><span class="Button">Home</span> &gt;&#160;<span class="Button">Settings</span> &gt; <span class="Button">Taxes</span></p>
            <p>See: <a href="How_to_Set_Tax_Rates.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{para}">How to Set Tax Rates</a></p>
            <p>When you've completed entering the item details, tap/click <span class="Button">Save</span>.</p>
            <p class="panel note tip">Tip: If this is your first time adding an item, or you are training a new employee, you can practice adding items in <span class="Button">Training Mode</span>. <span class="Button">Training Mode</span> acts as a sandbox, allowing you 'play around' in your system and add sample items without affecting your real-time data.
