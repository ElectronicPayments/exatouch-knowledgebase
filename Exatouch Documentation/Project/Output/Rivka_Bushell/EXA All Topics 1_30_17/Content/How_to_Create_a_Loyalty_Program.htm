        <h1>How to Create a Loyalty Program</h1>
        <p>A loyalty program can help ensure customer retention and satisfaction. If you wish to create a loyalty program, <a href="Contact_Technical_Support.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{para}">Contact Technical Support</a>  and ask them to activate the Loyalty Program in your Exatouch system.</p>
        <p>The Exatouch Loyalty Program is based on points. You'll set up a number of points that customers can earn for every dollar spent.</p>
        <p>For example, you can assign 10 points for every dollar. So if your customer spends 5 dollars, they earn 50 points in the loyalty system.</p>
        <p>The Loyalty Program also gives customers the opportunity to redeem their points. You set the point redemption value.</p>
        <p>For example, you can allow customers to redeem 100 points for 1 dollar. This means that for every 10 dollars spent, they can redeem 100 points.</p><a href="#loyaltyprogram" data-toggle="collapse"> <h2>Follow these instructions to set up a Loyalty Program:</h2></a>
