        <p class="summary">An item is an offering that a merchant provides to their customer. Your business's list of items makes up your Menu/Inventory. As part of Exatouch's comprehensive service offering, we provide complimentary Menu/Inventory import service. When you first sign up for Exatouch, our in-house specialists will program your Menu and import your Inventory. If you choose not to use our Menu/Inventory import service, your <span class="Button">Items List</span> will be blank and you'll need to start adding items to your system. Even after your Menu/Inventory import is complete, you'll probably want to add additional items to your system.</p>
